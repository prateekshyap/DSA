/*Unlock Rooms

Medium

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers rooms. Each index i in rooms represents a room and rooms[i] represents different keys to unlock other rooms.

You are currently in an unlocked room 0 and every other room is locked. Given you can move freely between unlocked rooms, return whether you can unlock every room.

Constraints

    n, m â‰¤ 250 where n and m are the number of rows and columns in rooms.

Example 1
Input

rooms = [
    [1, 3],
    [2],
    [0],
    []
]

Output

true

Explanation

We start off at room 0 and can go to room 1 with its key. From room 1 we can go to room 2. Then, we can go back to room 0 and go to room 3.
